# Goal
The goal of this project was to demonstate my technical knowledge of full-stack as part of the API Developer Challenge included in the DALI Lab Application.

## Tools Used
I used the following tools:
* React
* Javascript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Google Maps API
* Weather API
* Bootstrap

### Functionality
Right now, you can sign up for an account and fill out the questionaire. Then you can sign in and your portal will populate with the temperature based off your geolocation, your name, your profile picture, your goals, and a google maps component you can interact with and play with. The profile picture is stuck right now to a picture of me, but will be fixed soon to allow for any profile picture to be used.
